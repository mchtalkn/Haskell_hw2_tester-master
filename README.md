# Haskell_hw2_tester
a tester for ceng_242 course hw 2

place HW2 :/ Haskell_hw2_tester-master directory and run "python3 pyTester" command
For generating your own outputs, change custom_input.txt file and run generate file function. Your outputs will be generated in custom_output_file

note:tester does not controls variable  names for assignCommonSubexpression function so it may (and probably) say Correct for incorrect outputs (ex. it returns true for (x\*x\*y == y\*y\*x) but not(x\*x\*y == y\*y\*y))

TO DO: Rewrite tester.h
